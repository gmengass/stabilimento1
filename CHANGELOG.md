## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Project skeleton, workflow docs, Claude agents and commands.
- App scaffold: Next.js 16, PostgreSQL migrations with rollback, `/health` endpoint,
  Docker Compose stack and CI.
- Beach layout schema: venues, areas, lines and numbered umbrella/sunbed spots, with a demo
  seed (`npm run db:seed`).
- Interface in Italian and English, with a language switcher on every screen that keeps
  typed input; the choice is remembered in a cookie.
- Staff and admin login with username and password; every screen needs a login. Sessions
  last 12 hours, and logins are rate-limited.
- Admins manage staff accounts at `/admin/staff`: create, disable/enable, reset password.
- First admin account via `npm run db:seed-admin` (or `docker compose run --rm seed-admin`).
- The interface language is saved on the user and follows them to any device.
